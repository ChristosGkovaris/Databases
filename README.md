# Databases
Welcome to the "Databases" repository. This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts designed to demonstrate key database operations and analysis techniques.
This repository includes queries for tasks such as sorting, filtering, and finding relationships in a relational database. It also includes
additional SQL scripts for managing data in specific use-case scenarios.
