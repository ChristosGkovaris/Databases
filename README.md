# Databases
Welcome to the "Databases" repository, a collection of SQL scripts designed to demonstrate key database operations and analysis techniques.
This repository includes queries for tasks such as sorting, filtering, and finding relationships in a relational database. It also includes
additional SQL scripts for managing data in specific use-case scenarios.


## Code Overview

**Q1_3.sql:** Find students enrolled in multiple courses and display their total credits.

**Q1_4.sql:** Retrieve students who have not enrolled in any courses during the current semester.

**Q1_5.sql:** Display the names and emails of students who are on academic probation.
